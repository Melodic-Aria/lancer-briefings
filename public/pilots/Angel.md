Born within the Cradle, early 4993u, Yuan experienced luxury in his early ages, taking on drone racing as a hobby. By 5013u, now a fast-rising up and coming professional racer pilot, Yuan is scouted by Union Navy and is persuaded into entering the Academy.

By 5016u, the fresh-faced Yuan, still followed by die-hard fans of drone racing, leaves the academy and is assigned to the ship 'Rio Grande'.
