# UNS-CV Rio Grande // 7.12.5016u
As of 1400 hours, the ship is on combat alert. Communications with the Ambassador on the surface indicated defense warnings were being sounded across Nov Elysia and then all communications went dark. We have been unable to raise the captain, ambassador or the local government.

According to flyover imagery gathered by **Rio**, Nov Elysia is under attack by Vestan Sovereignty forces, seeing significant deployment of mechanized chassis throughout the city.

Cressidium is not an official member of Union at this time and militarily, we aren’t authorized to intervene on behalf of the LSA in their conflict.

However, we cannot simply leave **Captain Farris** and **Ambassador Bannerjee** to ride this out on their own. As such, after conferring with the other officers aboard this ship, it’s been decided we will conduct a rescue operation.  The primary objective here is to locate and secure the captain and ambassador, then safely escort them to an extraction point. 

Rules of engagement for this operation are that you are not to engage unless fired upon. Our main priority here is to bring our people home safe.
