# Mission // #002
## Daybreak
# Goals
- Neutralize the enemy's comms jamming network, then locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee

# Stakes
- If you fail to neutralize the enemy jamming network on schedule, the LSA advance into Nov Elysia's central district will face heavy resistance, incurring serious casualties which may hinder their ability to retake the city effectively.
Should you then fail to locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee, it will likely result in them being taken prisoner or even killed.

# Reserves
- Sniper Team (Taco Tuesday)
- XC Battle Rifle (Angel)
- Hot-Load Ammunition (Rough Rider)
- Up-Armoring (Decaf)
- Reputation Up (Ember)
